        <h1>Mathematics & Physics</h1> <br>

        <p>
        One of my favorite webpages, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT OCW</a> has a lot of resources for
        <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/">Math</a>,
        and for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/">physics</a>. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I made only 1 html about them, I would point out doing and using mathematics can be very different.

        Anyway here's a very discrete way to lead you back to my
        <a href="/index.html">main page</a>,
        just in case if you couldn't press the backspace button or something.
