            &nbsp;My name is <b>Lajos Molnár</b>, and <u>I'm bad at introducing myself</u>.
            You may think that I'm gonna write something funny, but this is a pretty low effort simple text here.
            This is just a webpage about - <em>me</em>.. &nbsp;
            Don't blame me.. This is what I have to do in CS50's problem set 5 (in 2019).
            It's 3 am and I'm really tired..
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;Fortunately (ogh cheesus this thing doesn't have autocorrect in it..) I'm quite an interesting person.
            Atleast this is what my friend said when I was said. <!-- /best friend -->
            The 4 favorite part of my life are
            <a href="/math-physics.html">math</a>,
            <a href="/math-physics.html">physics</a>,
            watching <a href="/mcu.html">MCU</a>, and riding
            <a href="/enduro.html">dirt bikes</a>
            and to be honest this pretty much takes up my whole life...

            (As you can see, getting laid isn't in the list.
            It's either because I don't want to share my personal life in a CS Poblem Set, or because it's not a part of my life,
            and I <i> may </i> or <i> may not </i> have experienced it upto the point where i started doing CS psets at 3am.)
